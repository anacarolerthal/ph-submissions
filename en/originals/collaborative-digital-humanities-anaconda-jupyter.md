# Lesson goals

Sharability and repeatabilty are core goals for all research; this tutorial will help you meet those goals more easily with your digital humanities research. Here we show you how to combine the power of [Anaconda](https://anaconda.org) (a data-science-focused environment manager) with [Jupyter](http://jupyter.org) (a browser-based interactive development environment [increasingly employed by humanists](https://conferences.oreilly.com/jupyter/jup-ny/public/schedule/detail/59878?cmp=tw-data-confsched-lp-jpny17_digital_humanities_session_as)) to create a development environment conducive to creating reproducible digital humanities research.

This tutorial is geared toward intermediate to advanced users who are comfortable using the command line and already know some python. 


# Anaconda for re-createable development environments
## What is Anaconda?
If we want to share our research, we need a straightforward way to allow collaborators to recreate the environment that we used to conduct that research. Practically, this means we need to make it as easy as possible for collaborators to install all the packages they need to run our code. Anaconda solves this problem, allowing you and your collaborators to easily create and maintain many different python environments on the same computer. 

## Download & install Anaconda

### Install on Unix/Mac
Choose the python 3 Anaconda installation utility for your [operating system](https://www.continuum.io/downloads). 

After downloading the installer, simply open the file and follow the prompts to complete the installaion.


### Install on Windows
Choose the python 3 Anaconda installation utility for your [version of Windows](https://www.continuum.io/downloads). 
You'll notice there are two options for Windows anaconda installations, 32-bit and 64-bit. If you're unsure which you need, 
follow [these instructions](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/15056/windows-7-32-64-bit-faq) to determine what type of 
system you use.

## How to use Anaconda

### Create a new enviroment

After installing Anaconda, open a terminal (or command prompt in Windows) and create an environment by using the `conda` command:

```bash
public:~ thomasj$ conda create -n prog_hist_env python=3
```

This tells Anaconda to create a new environment named `prog_hist_env` using the newest release of python 3.

Our newly created enviroment comes initialized with some packages already installed. You can use another sub-command of `conda` to see what's currently installed in a given environment:

```bash
public:~ thomasj$ conda list --name prog_hist_env
```

which will give output that looks something like this:

```bash
public:~ thomasj$ conda list --name prog_hist_env
# packages in environment at /Users/thomasj/anaconda/envs/prog_hist_env:
#
openssl                   1.0.2l                        0  
pip                       9.0.1                    py36_1  
python                    3.6.2                         0  
readline                  6.2                           2  
setuptools                27.2.0                   py36_0  
sqlite                    3.13.0                        0  
tk                        8.5.18                        0  
wheel                     0.29.0                   py36_0  
xz                        5.2.2                         1  
zlib                      1.2.8                         3  
```

### Activate your Anaconda environment

In order to use your enviroment for development, you need to 'activate' it by running the `activate` script included with Anaconda.

Mac/Unix
```bash
public:~ thomasj$ source activate prog_hist_env
```

Windows
```bash
C:\>activate prog_hist_env
```

<div class='alert'>
When an environemnt is activated, the name of that environment, here 'prog_hist_env', is prepended to the shell prompt.
</div>


### Install python packages

After activating your environment, you can install any package you find in the [anaconda package repository](https://anaconda.org/) by executing the `conda` command listed there.

For instance, python has a powerful tool for autoformatting code (which also works with Jupyter notebooks, described below). It's a separate package called `autopep8` which you need to install indpendently. To do so, simply conda install it:

```bash
(prog_hist_env) public:ph-submissions thomasj$ conda install autopep8 
```

If you're already familiar with pip from the [pip tutorial](https://programminghistorian.org/lessons/installing-python-modules-pip),
you can use that with an *activated* Anaconda environment as well. 

```bash
(prog_hist_env) public:ph-submissions thomasj$ pip install autopep8
```

So, what's the difference between calling `pip` from within an Anaconda environment and calling `pip` without activating an environment? The difference is subtle but essential. If `pip install` (or `conda install`) is called from within an Anaconda environment, packages will be installed under an environment-specific directory (e.g., /Users/thomasj/anaconda/envs/prog_hist_env). When `pip` is called directly from the command line, packages will be installed in the system python directory (if Anaconda has not been installed) or in the Anaconda root environment (e.g., /Users/thomasj/anaconda) if it has been installed.

Information about what Anaconda enironment is stored where can be accessed by using the following command:

```bash
public:~ thomasj$ conda info -e
# conda environments:
#
flask_env                /Users/thomasj/anaconda/envs/flask_env
geopandas_test_env       /Users/thomasj/anaconda/envs/geopandas_test_env
prog_hist_env            /Users/thomasj/anaconda/envs/prog_hist_env
py3k                     /Users/thomasj/anaconda/envs/py3k
root                  *  /Users/thomasj/anaconda
```


## Save an environment configuration as a text file

After building your environment, you can create a sharable text specification of the packages installed in your environment:

```bash
public:~ thomasj$ conda env export -n prog_hist_env
DEPRECATION: The default format will switch to columns in the future. You can use --format=(legacy|columns) (or define a format=(legacy|columns) in your pip.conf under the [list] section) to disable this warning.
name: prog_hist_env
channels:
- !!python/unicode
  'conda-forge'
- !!python/unicode
  'defaults'
dependencies:
- !!python/unicode
  'appnope=0.1.0=py36_0'
- !!python/unicode
  'bleach=1.5.0=py36_0'
- !!python/unicode
  'ca-certificates=2017.7.27.1=0'
- !!python/unicode
  'certifi=2017.7.27.1=py36_0'
[...]
```

You can redirect the output of this command to a text file for easy sharing and version control.

```bash
(prog_hist_env) public:~ thomasj$ source activate prog_hist_env
(prog_hist_env) public:~ thomasj$ conda env export > environment.yml
```

This text file can be used by anyone to recreate the exact Anaconda environment in which you developed your code. 

DO NOT RUN:
```bash
public:~ thomasj$ conda env create -f environment.yml -n new_env
```

# Jupyter for notebook-based exploratory research

## What's Jupyter?

Simply, the Jupyter project provides an intuitive environment for collaborative analytical code development. Jupyter is a client-server application. You run a Jupyter server from your computer and connect to this server from a browser to do your development in 'notebooks.' This system will become more clear, but the key benefit of this approach is that you can easly combine and preserve results of exploratory analysis with the code necessary to reproduce that analysis.


Jupyter supports a number of languages (including python and R). Jupyter provides a good set of [example notebooks](https://github.com/jupyter/jupyter/wiki/A-gallery-of-interesting-Jupyter-Notebooks#introductory-tutorials). We'll show you how to download and run these example notebooks below.

## Install Jupyter

To install Jupyter, activate your Anaconda environment:

```bash
public:~ thomasj$ source activate prog_hist_env
```

and execute the following command: 
        
```bash
(prog_hist_env) public:~ thomasj$ conda install jupyter 
```

## Start the Jupyter server

To use Jupyter, you need to start a Jupyter process in your activated environment (on your local computer):
        
```bash
(prog_hist_env) public:~ thomasj$ jupyter notebook 
```

The ouptput of this command will look something like this: 
   
```bash     
(prog_hist_env) public:~ thomasj$ jupyter notebook
[W 11:03:55.616 NotebookApp] server_extensions is deprecated, use nbserver_extensions
[I 11:03:56.636 NotebookApp] [jupyter_nbextensions_configurator] enabled 0.2.5
[I 11:03:56.644 NotebookApp] Serving notebooks from local directory: /Users/thomasj/programming_historian_tutorial
[I 11:03:56.644 NotebookApp] 0 active kernels 
[I 11:03:56.645 NotebookApp] The Jupyter Notebook is running at: http://localhost:8888/?token=25405cce1cc84214ce0880cea87fca6e8de29dc84e851546
[I 11:03:56.645 NotebookApp] Use Control-C to stop this server and shut down all kernels (twice to skip confirmation).
[C 11:03:56.646 NotebookApp] 
 
    Copy/paste this URL into your browser when you connect for the first time,
    to login with a token:
    http://localhost:8888/?token=25405cce1cc84214ce0880cea87fca6e8de29dc84e851546
```

Copy and paste the url as instructed into a Chrome or Safari web browser.

## How to use Jupyter notebooks


### Create a new notebook

You will get a page that looks like this: 

{% include figure.html filename="start-screen-annot.png" caption="Fig. 1 Notebook directory is empty to start with." %}

Create a new notebook by selecting `new -> Python 3` from the dropdown in the top right corner. 

You're now ready to start coding. You can execute code directly in this notebook. There's now no need to drop down to the command line to execute code.

{% include figure.html filename="basic_notebook_cropped.png" caption="Fig. 2 A blank notebook." %}
        
### Navigate the notebook menu

Jupyter notebooks are designed around cells. You can use the menu to add, delete, reorder and execute cells.

{% include figure.html filename="menu_cropped.png" caption="Fig. 3 Menu." %}

Add a cell by pressing the add button:

{% include figure.html filename="add_cell_cropped.png" caption="Fig. 4 Add cell." %}

Execute a code cell by pressing the step-forward button:

{% include figure.html filename="step_forward_cropped.png" caption="Fig. 5 Step forward button executes a cell." %}

When you execute code, the results appear below the cell

{% include figure.html filename="execution_cropped.png" caption="Fig. 6 Code appears below the cell." %}


### Change cell modes

Cells have an 'edit mode' and a 'command mode.' When you click inside the cell, the edge turns blue and the cell becomes editable. Arrow keys will then allow you to navigate within the cell:

{% include figure.html filename="edit_mode_cropped.png" caption="Fig. 7 Edit mode." %}

To enter command mode, press `esc`. The cell edge turns green and arrow keys will now allow you to move between cells:

{% include figure.html filename="command_mode_cropped.png" caption="Fig. 8 Command mode." %}


### Markdown cells

While you can execute code from within cells, you can also add markdown to your notebooks. You can make any cell a markdown cell by changing its cell type from the menu:

{% include figure.html filename="markdown_menu.png" caption="Fig. 9 Change cell type to markdown." %}

You can now type markdown into this cell:

{% include figure.html filename="markdown_plaintext_cropped.png" caption="Fig. 10 Markdown cell." %}

If you execute it, Jupyter will render the markdown in-place:

{% include figure.html filename="markdown_rendered_cropped.png" caption="Fig. 11 Rendered markdown cell." %}


### Cells share execution state

Importantly, all cells in the same notebook share information. So, if you define a variable in one cell, it will have the same value in the next cell:

{% include figure.html filename="shared_state_cropped.png" caption="Fig. 12 Program execution state is shared between cells." %}

### Python help information available from Jupyter

Jupyter allows you to easily get help information on any python object by simply adding a `?` to the end of the object name and executing the cell:

{% include figure.html filename="usage_cropped.png" caption="Fig. 13 Access python help information from the notebook." %}

Usage information appears in a panel at the bottom of the browser.

### Share your notebook analyses

1. Check your `.ipynb` file into a github repository. Github will render the code and output from your notebook.
2. Download a `pdf`, `html`, or `markdown` version of your file.


<div class="alert-warning">
You can check .ipynb files into github and github will store, preserve, and render them correctly, but storing large amounts of binary output to git can lead the repository to grow in size rapidly. If you run into issues with repository size, see <a href="https://gist.github.com/minrk/6176788">this page</a>.
</div>



# Example: running the sample Jupyter notebooks with Anaconda 

As mentioned above, one of the benefits of the Juputer + Anaconda setup is that this combination makes it easy to share analyses. We'll demonstrate this facility by cloning Jupyter's github repository, creating a conda environment from their `environment.yml`, and launching their sample notebooks (referenced above). 

1. clone the Jupyter repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/jupyter/notebook
```
2. create a conda environment from the included package list
```bash
cd notebook
conda env create -f docs/environment.yml -n jupyter_test_env
```
3. launch Jupyter from the folder of example notebooks
```bash
source activate jupyter_test_env
conda install jupyter # Jupyter isn't a base requirement of the notebook repo
cd docs/source/examples/Notebook
jupyter notebook --no-browser --ip=0.0.0.0
```

You can now edit & run the full set of Jupyter example notebooks locally:

{% include figure.html filename="jupyter_example_notebooks.png" caption="Fig. 14 Running Jupyter example notebooks locally." %}
